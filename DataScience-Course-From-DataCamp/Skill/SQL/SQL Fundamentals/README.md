## SQL Fundamentals
Learn the fundamental skills necessary to interact with the majority of dialects of SQL -- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and others! The skills you learn by taking these courses will empower you to join tables, summarize data, and answer your data analysis and data science questions.

### 1. Intro to SQL for Data Science
The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. Much of the world's raw data–from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories–lives in organized collections of tables called *relational databases*. Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced *ess-cue-ell*, or *sequel*). This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!

### 2. Joining Data in SQL
Now that you've learned the basics of SQL in our Intro to SQL for Data Science course, it's time to supercharge your queries using joins and relational set theory! In this course you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self-joins, semi-joins, anti-joins and cross joins - fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. You'll fear set theory no more, after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will see a visual perspective to grasp the ideas throughout the course using the mediums of Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations.

### 3. Intermediate SQL
So you've learned how to aggregate and join data from tables in your database — now what? How do you manipulate, transform, and make the most sense of your data? This intermediate-level course will teach you several key functions necessary to wrangle, filter, and categorize information in a relational database, expand your SQL toolkit, and answer complex questions. You will learn the robust use of CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions — all while discovering some interesting facts about soccer using the European Soccer Database. Let's score some goals with SQL!

### 4. SQL for Exploratory Data Analysis
You have access to a database. Now what do you do? Building on your existing skills joining tables, using basic functions, grouping data, and using subqueries, the next step in your SQL journey is learning how to explore a database and the data in it. Using data from Stack Overflow, Fortune 500 companies, and 311 help requests from Evanston, IL, you'll get familiar with numeric, character, and date/time data types. You'll use functions to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data without leaving the database. Errors and inconsistencies in the data won't stop you! You'll learn common problems to look for and strategies to clean up messy data. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to start exploring your own PostgreSQL databases and analyzing the data in them.
