## List comprehensions and generators
In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists and lists of lists in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python Data Science toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory but instead generate on the fly.

### Writing list comprehensions
You now have all the knowledge necessary to begin writing list comprehensions! Your job in this exercise is to write a list comprehension that produces a list of the squares of the numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

### Nested list comprehensions
Great! At this point, you have a good grasp of the basic syntax of list comprehensions. Let's push your code-writing skills a little further. In this exercise, you will be writing a list comprehension within another list comprehension, or nested list comprehensions. It sounds a little tricky, but you can do it!

Let's step aside for a while from strings. One of the ways in which lists can be used are in representing multi-dimension objects such as **matrices**. Matrices can be represented as a list of lists in Python. For example a 5 x 5 matrix with values `0` to `4` in each row can be written as:

```python
matrix = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

Your task is to recreate this matrix by using nested listed comprehensions. Recall that you can create one of the rows of the matrix with a single list comprehension. To create the list of lists, you simply have to supply the list comprehension as the **output expression** of the overall list comprehension:

`[`\[*output expression*\] `for` *iterator variable* `in` *iterable*`]`

Note that here, the **output expression** is itself a list comprehension.

### Using conditionals in comprehensions (1)
You've been using list comprehensions to build lists of values, sometimes using operations to create these values.

An interesting mechanism in list comprehensions is that you can also create lists with values that meet only a certain condition. One way of doing this is by using conditionals on iterator variables. In this exercise, you will do exactly that!

Recall from the video that you can apply a conditional statement to test the iterator variable by adding an `if` statement in the optional predicate expression part after the `for` statement in the comprehension:

`[` *output expression* `for` *iterator variable* `in` *iterable* `if` *predicate expression* `]`.

You will use this recipe to write a list comprehension for this exercise. You are given a list of strings `fellowship` and, using a list comprehension, you will create a list that only includes the members of `fellowship` that have 7 characters or more.

### Using conditionals in comprehensions (2)
In the previous exercise, you used an `if` conditional statement in the predicate expression part of a list comprehension to evaluate an iterator variable. In this exercise, you will use an `if-else` statement on the *output* expression of the list.

You will work on the same list, `fellowship` and, using a list comprehension and an `if-else` conditional statement in the output expression, create a list that keeps members of `fellowship` with 7 or more characters and replaces others with an empty string. Use `member` as the iterator variable in the list comprehension.

### Dict comprehensions
Comprehensions aren't relegated merely to the world of lists. There are many other objects you can build using comprehensions, such as dictionaries, pervasive objects in Data Science. You will create a dictionary using the comprehension syntax for this exercise. In this case, the comprehension is called a **dict comprehension**.

Recall that the main difference between a list comprehension and a *dict comprehension* is the use of curly braces `{}` instead of `[]`. Additionally, members of the dictionary are created using a colon `:`, as in `<key> : <value>`.

You are given a list of strings fellowship and, using a **dict comprehension**, create a dictionary with the members of the list as the keys and the length of each string as the corresponding values.

### Write your own generator expressions
You are familiar with what generators and generator expressions are, as well as its difference from list comprehensions. In this exercise, you will practice building generator expressions on your own.

Recall that generator expressions basically have the same syntax as list comprehensions, except that it uses parentheses `()` instead of brackets `[]`; this should make things feel familiar! Furthermore, if you have ever iterated over a dictionary with `.items()`, or used the `range()` function, for example, you have already encountered and used generators before, without knowing it! When you use these functions, Python creates generators for you behind the scenes.

Now, you will start simple by creating a generator object that produces numeric values.

### Changing the output in generator expressions
Great! At this point, you already know how to write a basic generator expression. In this exercise, you will push this idea a little further by adding to the output expression of a generator expression. Because generator expressions and list comprehensions are so alike in syntax, this should be a familiar task for you!

You are given a list of strings `lannister` and, using a generator expression, create a generator object that you will iterate over to print its values.

### Build a generator
In previous exercises, you've dealt mainly with writing generator expressions, which uses comprehension syntax. Being able to use comprehension syntax for generator expressions made your work so much easier!

Now, recall from the video that not only are there generator expressions, there are *generator functions* as well. **Generator functions** are functions that, like generator expressions, yield a series of values, instead of returning a single value. A generator function is defined as you do a regular function, but whenever it generates a value, it uses the keyword `yield` instead of `return`.

In this exercise, you will create a generator function with a similar mechanism as the generator expression you defined in the previous exercise:

```python
lengths = (len(person) for person in lannister)
```

### List comprehensions for time-stamped data
You will now make use of what you've learned from this chapter to solve a simple data extraction problem. You will also be introduced to a data structure, the pandas **Series**, in this exercise. We won't elaborate on it much here, but what you should know is that it is a data structure that you will be working with a lot of times when analyzing data from pandas DataFrames. You can think of DataFrame columns as single-dimension arrays called Series.

In this exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to extract the time from time-stamped Twitter data. The pandas package has been imported as `pd` and the file `'tweets.csv'` has been imported as the df DataFrame for your use.

### Conditional list comprehensions for time-stamped data
Great, you've successfully extracted the data of interest, the time, from a pandas DataFrame! Let's tweak your work further by adding a conditional that further specifies which entries to select.

In this exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to extract the time from time-stamped Twitter data. You will add a conditional expression to the list comprehension so that you only select the times in which `entry[17:19]` is equal to `'19'`. The pandas package has been imported as `pd` and the file `'tweets.csv'` has been imported as the `df` DataFrame for your use.
